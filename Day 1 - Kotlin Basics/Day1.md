# Day 1 - Kotlin introduction and Android Components

In this day, you'll learn how to build and run your first Android app in Kotlin. Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the JVM and is completely interoperable with Java. Kotlin is an officially supported language for developing Android apps, along with Java.

If you like guided tutorials, you might want to check out this codelab [build-your-first-android-app-kotlin](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-app-kotlin/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) we have based this workshop on the codelab 

## What you'll learn

- How to use Android Studio to build your app.
- How to run your app on a device or in the emulator.
- How to add interactive buttons.
- How to display a second screen.

## What you must know already

This codelab is written for programmers and assumes you know either Java or Kotlin. If you are an experienced programmer and you are adept at reading code, you will likely be able to follow this codelab even if you don't have much experience with Kotlin.

If you do not know any Kotlin, check this [Kotlin Basic Syntax](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html) link it will teach you what you need to know to move forward with the workshop. 

To work through this codelab, you will need a computer that can run Android Studio (or already has Android Studio installed). Install Android Studio following [this instructions](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/AndroidWorkshops_BCN/blob/master/Installation.md)
