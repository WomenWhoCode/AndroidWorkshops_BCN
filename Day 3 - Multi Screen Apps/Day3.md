Learn the basics of Android and Java programming, and take the first step on your journey to becoming an Android developer! This course is designed for students who are new to programming, and want to learn how to build Android apps. You don’t need any programming experience to take this course.

By the end of this course, you will have learned how to build an app’s layout and then practiced those skills by making a birthday card app and you will have learned how to make your app interactive using buttons and changing text.

If you like guided tutorials, you might want to check out this course [Android Basics: User Interface](https://eu.udacity.com/course/android-basics-user-interface--ud834) and [Android Basics: User Input](https://eu.udacity.com/course/android-basics-user-input--ud836) we will be following both courses through the workshop.
