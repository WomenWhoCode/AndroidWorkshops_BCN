Learn the basics of Android and Kotlin programming, and take the first step on your journey to becoming an Android developer! This course is designed for students who are new to programming, and want to learn how to build Android apps. 

By the end of this course, you will have learned how to build an appâ€™s layout and then practiced those skills by making a form to collect user input.

During this second workshop we will follow the following codelab:

## What you'll learn

- How to built app's layout on Android Studio
- How to make your app interact with a user

## What you must know already

This codelab is written for programmers and assumes you know either Java or Kotlin. If you are an experienced programmer and you are adept at reading code, you will likely be able to follow this codelab even if you don't have much experience with Kotlin.

If you do not know any Kotlin, check this [Kotlin Basic Syntax](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html) link it will teach you what you need to know to move forward with the workshop. 

If you missed the past day check out [Day 1](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/AndroidWorkshops_BCN/blob/master/Day%201%20-%20Kotlin%20Basics/README.md) and follow the codelab to learn basics of Kotlin and Android Development. 

To work through this codelab, you will need a computer that can run Android Studio (or already has Android Studio installed). Install Android Studio following [these instructions](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/AndroidWorkshops_BCN/blob/master/Installation.md)
