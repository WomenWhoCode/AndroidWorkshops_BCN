# Day 5 - Data Storage

This course is designed for students who have completed [Day 1](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/AndroidWorkshops_BCN/blob/master/Day1%20-%20Kotlin%20Basics/Day1.md),  [Day 2](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/AndroidWorkshops_BCN/blob/master/Day%202%20-%20Android%20Basics/Day2.md),  [Day 3](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/AndroidWorkshops_BCN/blob/master/Day%203%20-%20Multi%20Screen%20Apps/Day3.md) and [Day 4](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/AndroidWorkshops_BCN/blob/master/Day%204%20-%20Networking/Day4.md).

In this course, you will learn about the importance of data persistence when building an Android app. We'll introduce you to the fundamentals of SQL, the programming language needed to interact with an SQLite relational database. SQLite is a commonly used method to store large sets of data locally on an Android device.

You'll also learn how to work with Content Providers, which help your data storage to be bug free and to be shared, if you choose, with other apps.

## What you must know already

This codelab is written for programmers and assumes you know either Java or Kotlin. If you are an experienced programmer and you are adept at reading code, you will likely be able to follow this codelab even if you don't have much experience with Kotlin.

If you do not know any Kotlin, check this [Kotlin Basic Syntax](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html) link it will teach you what you need to know to move forward with the workshop. 

If you missed the past day check out [Day 1](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/AndroidWorkshops_BCN/blob/master/Day1%20-%20Kotlin%20Basics/Day1.md),  [Day 2](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/AndroidWorkshops_BCN/blob/master/Day%202%20-%20Android%20Basics/Day2.md) and [Day 3](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/AndroidWorkshops_BCN/blob/master/Day%203%20-%20Multi%20Screen%20Apps/Day3.md) and [Day 4](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/AndroidWorkshops_BCN/blob/master/Day%204%20-%20Networking/Day4.md).

To work through this codelab, you will need a computer that can run Android Studio (or already has Android Studio installed). Install Android Studio following [this instructions](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/AndroidWorkshops_BCN/blob/master/Installation.md)
