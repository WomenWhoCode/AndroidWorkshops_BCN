# Android Workshop

Please, follow the installation instructions [here](/Installation.md) before the day of the workshop. 

Downloading the required tools takes time, 
so it is important to come prepared, that way you will be ready to start coding and will benefit from it most.

Bear in mind that the wifi in the workshops may be a bit slow so we strongly recommend installing before hand.

Do not hesitate to write a comment in the meetup or the WWCodeBCN Slack if you have an issue with the installation and we will be happy to help you. In order for us to help you as soon as possible, indicate what is your operating system and the exact errors you are seeing.

## I don't know code or Android can I attend? 

Yes ‚ò∫Ô∏è this meetup will teach you Android from zero, you do not need to know anything about Android development or Kotlin as a language. 

You should have some familiarity with coding concepts though, we won't be teaching what classes, functions or strings are. But no worries if you do not know any Code concepts you can easily read them in this posts: 

- [Basic syntax](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html)
- [Gentle Introduction to Programming](https://link.medium.com/0L1UnynxDV)

## I am going to miss one of the workshops, can I still come? Can I catch up? 

You are in luck üòÑ everything we will be teaching will be following online courses and documentation to make this course more accessible to people. This way you can catch up if you missed a day or just redo the exercises to make sure you understand the concepts. 

Go inside of the folder of any day you want to re do or that you missed, you will find the appropriate links there. And don't forget to do your homework before the next class!!
